The MealMingle app's system architecture flow revolves around facilitating the sharing of surplus meals and connecting individuals in need with available food resources. Users register and create profiles, enabling them to create listings for surplus meals or browse and request meals based on their preferences. NGOs can directly book meals for individuals in need, streamlining the process. The app facilitates communication between users and provides features for meal collection or delivery. Additionally, users can explore volunteer opportunities to support the initiative. This system architecture flow ensures efficient coordination, transparency, and community involvement in addressing food waste and food insecurity.
